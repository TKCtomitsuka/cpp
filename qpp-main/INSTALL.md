# Quantum++ installation instructions

Quantum++ is a header-only library that uses [CMake](https://www.cmake.org/) as its build/install system. Quantum++ is
platform-independent, supporting [UNIX](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) (including
[macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/)) and UNIX-like operating systems (e.g., [Linux](https://www.linux.org)), as well
as [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

## Pre-requisites

- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version 3.12 or later
- [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) linear algebra library
- A C++17 compliant compiler, e.g., [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [clang](https://clang.llvm.org),
  [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) etc.

## Optional

- [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) compiler shared libraries and include header files, in case you
  want to enable interoperability with MATLAB. If enabled, allows applications build with Quantum++ to save/load
  Quantum++ matrices and vectors to/from MATLAB. The locations of the MATLAB compiler shared libraries and header files
  are platform-specific, e.g., under Linux, they may be located under `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2021a/bin/glnxa64` and
  `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2021a/extern/include`, respectively. On your platform the locations may of course differ.

## Configuring the system

For UNIX/UNIX-like/Windows, first create an out-of-source build directory, e.g., from the project's root directory type
in a terminal/console/command prompt

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

Then, configure the system by typing (from inside the newly created `build` directory)

```bash
cmake ..
```

If you plan to compile the [examples](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/examples) or the
[unit tests](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/unit_tests) you may need to pass additional arguments to
CMake,

```bash
cmake .. [optional arguments]
```

where [optional arguments] are passed as `-DOPTIONAL_ARGUMENT=VALUE`. The Quantum++-specific optional arguments are:

Optional argument | Value | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
`EIGEN3_INSTALL_DIR` | `/path/to/eigen3` | Path to Eigen3 installation, if not automatically detected
`USE_QISKIT_SPECS` | `ON/OFF` [`OFF` by default] | Enables/disables using Qiskit specifications instead of the OpenQASM 2.0 standard; see [`DISCREPANCIES.md`](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/DISCREPANCIES.md)
`WITH_OPENMP` | `ON/OFF` [`ON` by default] | Enables (if available)/disables OpenMP multi-processing library
`WITH_EXAMPLES` | `ON/OFF` [`OFF` by default] | Enables/disables examples as a CMake build target
`WITH_UNIT_TESTS` | `ON/OFF` [`OFF` by default] |  Enables/disables unit tests as a CMake build target
`WITH_MATLAB=ON/OFF` | `ON/OFF` [`OFF` by default] | Enables (if available)/disables interoperability with MATLAB, allowing to detect MATLAB installation automatically. If enabled, allows applications to save/load Quantum++ matrices and vectors to/from MATLAB.
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` | `/path/to/install` | Installs Quantum++ header files in a non-standard location (e.g., due to lack of admin. rights)

If `WITH_MATLAB=ON` and the system could not detect your MATLAB installation, you can manually specify the path to
MATLAB's installation directory via the additional argument

    MATLAB_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/MATLAB

If you still receive errors, you can manually specify the path to MATLAB's required libraries and header files via the
additional arguments

    MATLAB_LIB_DIR=/path/to/MATLAB/libs
    MATLAB_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/MATLAB/headers

## Installing Quantum++ into the default/custom target directory

To install Quantum++ into a target directory (after [Configuring the system](#Configuring-the-system)) follow the
platform-specific instructions below.

### UNIX/UNIX-like

From the same out-of-source build directory execute

```bash
sudo make install 
```

or

```bash
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

The commands above will install Quantum++ in: `/usr/local/include/qpp` and `/usr/local/lib/cmake/qpp`.

### Windows

From the same out-of-source build directory execute under an Administrator Command Prompt

```shell
cmake --build . --target INSTALL
```

The commands above will install Quantum++ in: `C:\Program Files (x86)\qpp`

### FreeBSD

We are proud to be part of the [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) operating system as an official package. If you are
running FreeBSD, you can skip the CMake configuration described in [Configuring the system](#Configuring-the-system)
above and install Quantum++ with the one-liner

    pkg install quantum++

Note that the FreeBSD version of Quantum++ may not correspond to the latest release.

## Building and running a standalone application that uses Quantum++

Below is a minimal `CMakeLists.txt` of a standalone application that uses Quantum++. For simplicity, we assume that the
whole application is located in a single file `src/main.cpp`, and the `CMakeLists.txt` is located in the project's root
directory.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)
project(my_qpp_app)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

# Disable spurious Eigen warnings with MSVC (warning STL4007)
if (MSVC)
    add_compile_definitions(_SILENCE_CXX17_ADAPTOR_TYPEDEFS_DEPRECATION_WARNING)
endif ()

# The line below is optional (uncomment if Quantum++ was installed in a
# non-standard location)

# set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/path/to/installed/qpp")

find_package(qpp REQUIRED)
add_executable(my_qpp_app src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_qpp_app PUBLIC ${QPP_LINK_DEPS} libqpp)
```

**Do not forget to ALWAYS add `${QPP_LINK_DEPS}` (verbatim) to `target_link_libraries()`!** (last line of the
`CMakeLists.txt` file above).

To build the application, first create an out-of-source build directory, e.g., under UNIX/UNIX-like execute

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

followed by configuring and building the application

```bash
cmake .. [optional arguments] && make -j8
```

where the optional arguments were described in the [Configuring the system](#Configuring-the-system) section. The
commands above will produce the `my_qpp_app` executable inside the `build` folder.

## Building and running a standalone application that uses Quantum++ without a build system

Quantum++ is a header-only library. So, technically you can build an application that uses Quantum++ without using a
building system, by simply using the compiler and specifying the location to all required dependencies, like below
(assumes UNIX/UNIX-like, adapt accordingly for Windows)

```bash
c++ -pedantic -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
    -O3 -DNDEBUG -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG \
    -isystem $HOME/eigen3 -I $HOME/qpp/include \
     src/main.cpp -o my_qpp_app
```

If you intend to go this route, we assume that you are familiar with how compilers work, so we won't add any more
explanations to what the line above does. We still highly recommend compiling and building your applications using a
modern build system such as [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).

## Building and running examples

We assume that you have already installed Quantum++, if not please go back and read the instructions above. We also
assume that you are now familiar with the CMake build system, so in the following we only showcase the commands, with no
further explanations. If the lines below are not clear, please read the instructions above, or look into the
[AppVeyor](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/.appveyor) or
[CircleCI](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/.circleci) continuous integration scripts to understand better
how to compile and run under various platforms (and using alternatives build systems such as,
e.g., [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)).

Finally, we assume that you type the commands below in a terminal/console/command prompt, inside an out-of-source build
directory, e.g., `./build`.

### UNIX/UNIX-like

```bash
cmake .. -DWITH_EXAMPLES=ON [optional arguments]
make -j8 examples
./bb84 # runs, e.g., the BB84 example
```

If you want to compile a single example/subset of examples, replace `make -j8 examples` with
`make -j8 example_target[s]`, e.g.,

```bash
make bb84 # builds the BB84 example
```

or

```bash
make -j8 bb84 grover # builds both BB84 and Grover examples
```

### Windows

```shell
cmake .. -DWITH_EXAMPLES=ON [optional arguments]
msbuild -verbosity:minimal -m:8 examples.vcxproj
.\Debug\bb84 # runs, e.g., the BB84 example
```

The examples will be built under the `./Debug` directory (default). You can also compile and build Release versions,
please go ahead and read more about CMake under Windows from your favourite source.

If you want to compile a single example/subset of examples, replace `msbuild -verbosity:minimal -m:8 examples.vcxproj`
with
`msbuild -verbosity:minimal -m:8 example_target[s].vcxproj`, e.g.,

```shell
msbuild -verbosity:minimal bb84.vcxproj # builds the BB84 example
```

or

```shell
msbuild -verbosity:minimal -m:8 bb84.vcxproj grover.vcxproj # builds both BB84 and Grover examples
```    

## Building and running unit tests

### UNIX/UNIX-like

```bash
cmake .. -DWITH_UNIT_TESTS=ON [optional arguments]
make -j8 unit_tests
ctest # or ./unit_tests/unit_tests
```

### Windows

```shell
msbuild -verbosity:minimal -m:8 .\unit_tests\unit_tests.vcxproj
ctest # or .\unit_tests\Debug\unit_tests.exe
```    

## Additional platform-specific instructions

#### macOS/OS X specific instructions

- We highly recommend installing [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.8 or later via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), as the native AppleClang does not offer OpenMP support.
- In case you get any compiler or linker errors when OpenMP is enabled, you need to install the `libomp` package, e.g.,
  execute

```bash
brew install libomp
```

#### MATLAB support under Windows

If building under Windows with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support, please add the location of
`libmx.dll` and `libmat.dll` (the `.dll` **and not** the `.lib` files) to your `PATH` environment variable. In our case
they are located under `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2021a\bin\win64`.
